# CineTrack üé¨

CineTrack is a movie tracking application built with ReactJS that allows users to search for, save, and manage their favorite movies. The app fetches data from the **Movie Database API (TMDb)** and provides an interactive, user-friendly interface. This project showcases my expertise in front-end development, API integration, and creating intuitive user experiences.
